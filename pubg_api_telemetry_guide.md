# PUBG API Telemetry Objects and Events Guide

## Overview

The PUBG API provides comprehensive telemetry data that contains detailed information about every event that occurs during a match. This includes player movements, weapon usage, item interactions, damage events, and much more.

## Key Resources

- **Official Documentation**: https://documentation.pubg.com/en/telemetry.html
- **Telemetry Events**: https://documentation.pubg.com/en/telemetry-events.html
- **Telemetry Objects**: https://documentation.pubg.com/en/telemetry-objects.html
- **API Assets & Data Dictionaries**: https://github.com/pubg/api-assets

## How to Access Telemetry Data

### Step 1: Get a Match Object
First, you need to retrieve a match from the matches endpoint. You'll need a match ID, which can be found in player objects from the players endpoint.

```bash
curl "https://api.pubg.com/shards/$platform/matches/$matchId" \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

### Step 2: Find the Telemetry Asset
Look for the "assets" reference in the match "relationships" object:

```json
"relationships": {
  "assets": {
    "data": [
      {
        "type": "asset",
        "id": "1ad97f85-cf9b-11e7-b84e-0a586460f004"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Get the Telemetry URL
Find the telemetry object with the matching ID in the included array:

```json
{
  "type": "asset",
  "id": "1ad97f85-cf9b-11e7-b84e-0a586460f004",
  "attributes": {
    "URL": "https://telemetry-cdn.pubg.com/pc-krjp/2018/01/01/0/0/1ad97f85-cf9b-11e7-b84e-0a586460f004-telemetry.json",
    "createdAt": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "description": "",
    "name": "telemetry"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Download Telemetry Data
Download the telemetry file (no API key required):

```bash
curl --compressed "https://telemetry-cdn.pubg.com/pc-krjp/2018/01/01/0/0/1ad97f85-cf9b-11e7-b84e-0a586460f004-telemetry.json" \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" \
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip"
```
